## Overview

This is my very first HTML, CSS project. I found it on frontendmentor.io. I have gone through the responsive web design course on https://www.freecodecamp.org/ as well as a tutorial provided by https://www.internetingishard.com/. I decided to put my knowledge to the test and develop my skills through application. It was very challenging but it allowed me to more understand what I have learned so far. I had a lot of fun on this project even though I had to walk away sometimes.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

In building this project my key takaway was in understanding the CSS box model and working with content, padding, border, margin and how they interact.


### Continued development

I still need much much more education and development in HTML and CSS but this is a very good start for me.

### Useful resources

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This helped me really get started coding and understand what exactly I was getting myself into. A great resource people brand new to the field.

- [Interneting is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/) - Interneting is hard has 14 chapters and 284 examples to code along with. This gave me some experience working in the code editor.

- YouTube University - YouTube is an excellent resource for anything and everything you need to learn. On this project I used it to understand and get started with Git and GitHub as well as to learn how to deploy my project on GitHub Pages.

## Acknowledgments

Shout out to my mentor Justin Schneider (Twitter: @justinmakescode) for all his help and guidance. He always picked up the phone or responded to my text when I needed it. One particular time we jumped on a video call so he could see why my code wasn't working and we discovered that I had spelled style wrong in my style element on my HTML markup!
